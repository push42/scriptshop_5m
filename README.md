# üíú Project 1211: ScriptShop 5M

There isn't a way to purchase directly on this website. It acts like a portfolio where i personally display my bought scripts to resell them.
I stopped having interest in GTA Roleplay and no longer develop for FiveM.
Feel free to modify my website or use it for yourself (ofcourse with your edited information), i really don't bother.
The contact form uses a database to save the send contact messages.


# What is this project about?

I personally lost interest in developing and maintaing a FiveM Server.
Because of this reason i setup a personal portfolio with all of my collected scripts over the past years.
This way people can easily see what kind of scripts i offer and directly contact me trough my website or via social profiles.
Feel free to customize this website to your liking and use it for whatever you please!
Happy Coding! <3
